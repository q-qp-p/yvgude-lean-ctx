# Context Engineering Layer

lean-ctx optimizes LLM context by compressing file reads, shell output, and search results.

## Mandatory Multi-Agent Delivery

For every substantive task in this repository, load and follow
`docs/internal/skills/agent-orchestration.md` before taking task actions.
Use a coordinated Codex CLI swarm of 2 to 15 agents for the work; do not
silently fall back to a single-agent workflow. Fifteen agents is a hard
concurrent maximum; choose the smallest effective swarm and give every agent a
distinct role.

This rule is owned by the orchestration lead. Agents with a concrete delegated
subtask are swarm workers: they coordinate through lean-ctx and complete their
assigned role, but do not recursively launch another swarm unless the lead
explicitly asks them to do so.

- **Runtime:** every Codex CLI agent MUST use `--model gpt-5.6-luna` and
  `-c 'model_reasoning_effort="max"'`.
- **LeanCTX coordination:** every agent registers on the lean-ctx agent bus,
  checks directives, and uses lean-ctx context tools; the lead records the
  integrated decision and progress through lean-ctx.
- **Topology:** assign independent, non-duplicative roles. Use a mapper or
  reviewer alongside the implementer; for non-parallel changes, the reviewer
  validates the implementer's result after it is ready.
- **Safe ownership:** only one agent may edit a given file or shared worktree at
  a time. Parallel agents investigate, test, or review in isolation unless
  explicit file ownership or separate worktrees are assigned.
- **Completion:** the lead integrates the findings, runs the relevant quality
  gates, and reports the agents' evidence. A task is not complete merely
  because an agent returned successfully.

Direct conversational answers, status updates, and clarification questions are
not substantive tasks and do not require a swarm. The user may explicitly
request a different runtime or a single-agent exception.

## Integration Mode: Replace

Native Read/Grep/Glob/Shell are **denied by policy**. lean-ctx MCP tools are the
only path for reading files and running commands:

- **Reads/Search** → `ctx_read`, `ctx_search`, `ctx_compose` (cached, 10 modes, images via ContentBlock)
- **Shell commands** → `ctx_shell` (95+ compression patterns)
- **File editing** → native Edit/StrReplace (lean-ctx only handles READ operations)
- **File finding** → `ctx_glob`, `ctx_tree`

Native tools will return a deny error with instructions to use ctx_* equivalents.
Override: set `hook_mode = "hybrid"` in `~/.config/lean-ctx/config.toml`.

## Subagent Compatibility (Cursor / Claude Code)

Cursor blocks MCP tools in `readonly: true` subagents (Task tool).
lean-ctx tools are MCP tools → they WILL FAIL in readonly subagents.

**Rules for spawning subagents:**
- Always set `readonly: false` when the subagent needs ctx_* tools
- Use `subagent_type: "generalPurpose"` — NOT `"explore"` (always readonly)
- lean-ctx tools declare `readOnlyHint: true` in MCP annotations

**Fallback (MCP unavailable):** deny hook detects MCP-down and allows native tools.

## CLI commands (optimized shell, lower overhead)

```bash
git status                   # compressed by configured agent shell/wrapper
cargo test                   # compressed by configured agent shell/wrapper
lean-ctx -c "git status"     # only if explicitly requested / documented unwrapped
lean-ctx ls src/              # directory map
```

## Development Workflow

When working on lean-ctx itself:

1. **Build without stopping the installed runtime**: `cd rust && cargo build --release`
2. **Test without stopping the installed runtime**: `cargo test --lib` + `cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings` + `cargo fmt --check`
3. **Install**: `lean-ctx dev-install` (build→atomic stop/install→restart)

Do not run `lean-ctx stop` before builds or tests. It unloads the user's global
proxy and daemon even though Cargo writes only to the worktree's target directory.
`lean-ctx dev-install` performs the required short stop immediately before replacing
the installed binary and restores autostart afterward.

## Session Continuity

lean-ctx automatically persists session context across restarts:
- **Findings**: Recent tool results (reads, searches, test outcomes)
- **Decisions**: Architecture choices made during the session
- **Files**: Touched files with summaries and modification status
- **Progress**: Task completion state and next steps

This data is delivered through the first tool call's `--- AUTO CONTEXT ---`
briefing (default `minimal_overhead = true`: initialize instructions stay
byte-stable for provider prompt caching, #498). With `minimal_overhead = false`
it is additionally injected at session start via the `ACTIVE SESSION` LITM block.

### Active Documentation (Agent Responsibility)

After completing a significant task (implementation, bugfix, refactoring):
1. Record the decision: `ctx_knowledge(action="remember", category="decision", content="...")`
2. Record progress: `ctx_session(action="task", value="<current task> [N%]")`
3. Record blockers: `ctx_knowledge(action="remember", category="blocker", content="...")`

After 30+ tool calls without documentation:
- lean-ctx will prompt with `[CHECKPOINT: please document current progress]`
- Respond by calling `ctx_session(action="task")` with current status

## Provider Pipeline (Context Engine)

External data sources (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Postgres, MCP bridges, custom REST) are first-class citizens.
All provider data flows through the same consolidation pipeline:

1. `ContextProvider::execute()` → raw `ProviderResult`
2. `consolidation::consolidate()` → `ConsolidationArtifacts` (BM25 chunks, graph edges, knowledge facts, cache entries)
3. `apply_artifacts_to_stores()` → persists to BM25 index, Graph index, ProjectKnowledge, Session cache (background thread)

This means `ctx_semantic_search` finds issues/PRs/tickets, `ctx_knowledge` recalls provider facts,
and `ctx_read` shows cross-source hints (e.g. "Issue #42 references this file").

## Agent Bus Registration (mandatory, first action)

Every ephemeral coding worker MUST register through the local MCP bus as its
first MCP operation: call `ctx_agent` with `action="register"`, its host type
(`codex`, `cursor`, or `claude`), and its assigned role. Retain the returned
local ID, then call `ctx_agent` with `action="read"` to check directives.

`lean-ctx agent register --id "<type>-$$" ...` is intentionally **not** for
ephemeral workers: it creates a durable, attested identity and using a shell
PID there turns normal short-lived worker history into misleading "active
agents". Reserve that CLI command for a deliberately provisioned, long-lived
identity with an owner. Use `ctx_agent action="list"` for project-scoped
workers, or `lean-ctx agent presence` for the local process view.

## Branch Hygiene (mandatory)

GitHub remote must stay clean: only `main` + `cla-signatures` + max 1 active PR branch per agent.

- **After merge → delete source branch**: `SKIP_PREFLIGHT=1 git push github --delete <branch>`
- **Branch naming**: `<type>/<issue-or-slug>` (e.g. `fix/1037-heal`, `feat/p4-usage-sink`)
- **Max 1 open branch per agent** on GitHub. No parallel feature branches.
- **Before push**: `git ls-remote --heads github | wc -l` — if >3, clean up first.
- **No branches without PRs** on GitHub. Either open a PR or keep it local.

## Compression Safety

lean-ctx shadow-mode compresses file reads. Edit tools (StrReplace, Write) can
write compression omission markers back to disk as literal text. The pre-commit
hook blocks such commits.

**If a commit is blocked or a file looks corrupted:**
```bash
LEAN_CTX_DISABLED=1 git restore --source=HEAD -- <file>   # restore raw content
LEAN_CTX_DISABLED=1 sed -i '' 's/old/new/g' <file>        # edit without hooks
```

**Never** use `git show commit:file > file` without `LEAN_CTX_DISABLED=1`.

`LEAN_CTX_DISABLED=1` bypasses all lean-ctx compression for a single command.

## Quality Bar

- Zero clippy warnings, all tests pass
- Security: PathJail, Shell Allowlist, bounded_lock, no hardcoded secrets
- No mock data, no placeholders, no stubs

## Quality Gate

Before every commit, all three checks must pass:

```bash
cargo test --lib 2>&1 | tail -5       # must show 0 failed
cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

## Output Determinism (#498)

Tool outputs MUST be deterministic functions of (file content, mode, CRP mode, task).
Provider-side prompt caching (Anthropic 90%, OpenAI 50% discount) rewards byte-stable text;
any timestamp, counter or random element in tool output bodies defeats it.

- No timestamps/counters in output bodies. Artifact paths are content-addressed
  (see `save_tee`: `{cmd_slug}_{blake3(cmd)[..8]}.log`).
- Dynamic additions (hints, checkpoints) only as state-triggered suffixes with stable headers.
- Regression guard: determinism tests in `ctx_read/tests.rs`, `ctx_search.rs`, `shell/redact.rs`.
