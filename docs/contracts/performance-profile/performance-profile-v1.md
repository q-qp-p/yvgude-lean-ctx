# Performance Profile v1

Contract version: **v1**

> **Status: Research contract.** This schema is target architecture, not an

Performance Profiles are portable, versioned configurations for how an agent
reads, searches, compresses, routes, and recovers context. They make a tested
set of choices shareable and reproducible across a local machine, a team, and a
benchmark environment.

## Schema

The normative machine-readable contract is
[performance-profile-v1.schema.json](performance-profile-v1.schema.json). A
profile MUST validate against it; unknown fields are rejected. `id`, `name`,
and `version` are required, and `version` uses Semantic Versioning.

All optional configuration sections are deliberately partial so a child profile
can override only the settings it changes. A deployed profile should set every
parameter whose value can affect a benchmark result.

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Metadata | Identity, ownership, publication scope, tags, and optional inheritance. |
| `context` | Token budget, reading and compression policy, reuse, recovery, search, and memory. |
| `capabilities` | Provider bindings for code context, shell output, knowledge, routing, and compression. |
| `constraints` | Quality, cost, latency, and verification limits. |
| `routing` | Model-tier cap and context-pressure degradation policy. |
| `pipeline` | Enables or disables intent, relevance, compression, and translation stages. |

Each present capability binding MUST name its `provider`; `strategy` and
`version` are provider-specific. Consumers SHOULD pin `version` for benchmark
or production use.

## Resolution and inheritance

`inherits` names a parent profile. Resolution happens before benchmarking or
deployment: a child value wins, objects merge recursively, and arrays replace
the parent array. A capability binding is an atomic provider choice and SHOULD
be replaced as a whole. Implementations MUST reject an unresolved parent or an
inheritance cycle.

## Calibrator relationship

The Calibrator optimizes a resolved Performance Profile, not an unstructured
set of runtime flags. It measures the profile against a workload and proposes
parameter changes that improve the stated quality, cost, or latency objective.
Accepted calibration output is published as a new profile version; an existing
version remains immutable for reproducible comparisons. Token measurements can
be recorded with the companion
[Tokenizer calibration evidence v1](../tokenizer-calibration-v1.md) contract.

## ExecutionReceipt relationship

Every benchmarked or deployed run SHOULD reference the exact profile identity
in its [ExecutionReceiptV1](../execution-receipt-v1.schema.json) `decision_refs`
array, for example `performance-profile://codex-rust-monorepo-v3@3.0.0`.
The reference records which configuration shaped the run while the receipt
records its cost, latency, decisions, and evidence.

Routing fields align with the profile overrides described by
[Intent Route v1](../intent-route-v1.md); provider choices can be described by
the [CapabilityManifestV1](../capability-manifest-v1.schema.json) contract.

## Lifecycle

1. **Create** — author a validating profile with a unique `id` and SemVer
   `version`.
2. **Benchmark** — run representative workloads and attach the profile
   reference to each ExecutionReceipt.
3. **Calibrate** — compare receipt evidence and adjust parameters to meet the
   declared constraints.
4. **Deploy** — resolve inheritance, pin providers, and promote the exact
   profile version.
5. **Version** — publish calibrated changes under a new SemVer version; retain
   the prior version for comparison and rollback.

## OSS and paid boundary

| Offering | Profile capability |
|---|---|
| OSS | Create profiles, run local benchmarks, and calibrate parameters manually. |
| Pro | Retain benchmark history and run automated parameter sweeps. |
| Enterprise | Add governance and continuous optimization for shared, production profiles. |

These additions are control-plane services; they do not restrict local profile
creation or execution. See [OSS Plane Separation v1](../oss-plane-separation-v1.md)
and [Local-Free Invariant v1](../local-free-invariant-v1.md).
